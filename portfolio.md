## 🛠 Technical Writing Projects

### 📘 Operations Manual - Bit Refinery
This project involved creating standard operating procedures for both new and existing employees seeking guidance on operational processes and troubleshooting. I collaborated with a team of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define best practices and document step-by-step procedures. As a result, the project led to cost reductions, improved customer satisfaction, and increased sales.
